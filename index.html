        <h2>Section 1: Interface sketch</h2>
        <p>The interface I chose is the digital menu of a restaurant nearby. The first screen the main page of the menu, which
            includes menu items with images.
            Clicking onto the image leads to a second screen, where users can see a larger image and detailed
            descriptions.
